## Introduction

- Blink is an innovative platform transforming the retail landscape through Electronic Shelf Labels (ESLs).

## Main Value

Blink offers two core advantages:

1. Real-Time ESL Price Tags: Unlike conventional ESLs, Blink's labels automatically update based on real-time data, displaying prices in multiple currencies. Sellers can set their own exchange rates, freeing them from manual price tag updates.
2. Three-Less Shopping Experience: With Blink ESLs, shopping becomes cashless, exchangeless, and checkoutless. Customers, even tourists, no longer need physical cash, currency exchange, or manual checkouts.

## Method

1. Price Tag Refreshing Scheduling: Blink employs scheduling algorithms to reduce ESL refresh rates, to extend the lifespan of ESLs.
2. Multi-Currency Display: Real-time exchange rates from the web calculate product prices, accommodating user-set exchange fees through an intuitive dashboard.
3. POS Integration: Blink seamlessly integrates with Point of Sale (POS) systems, streamlining revenue, cost, and stock management.
4. Account-Free, Device-Free: Customers don't require user accounts, and sellers can adopt Blink without facility upgrades.

## Comparative Advantages

1. vs. Amazon Fresh: Unlike Amazon Fresh's closed system, Blink is versatile for various sellers and simplifies checkout without costly technology.
2. vs. Checkout KIOSK Machine: Blink offers a cost-effective, user-friendly alternative to complex KIOSK machines.
3. vs. Payment Platforms (e.g., KakaoPay, Alipay, Paypal): Traditional platforms are online-oriented and lack customization for exchange fees, making them unsuitable for offline retail and international markets.

## Customer Segments (Market Size)

1. SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): Blink suits countries with volatile exchange rates, like Argentina.
2. SAM (Serviceable Available Market): Large retail chains such as TESCO, e-Mart, and Walmart can benefit from Blink's ESL system.
3. TAM (Total Available Market): Blink's potential extends to revolutionizing the global offline payment system, including large events like the 2023 BUSAN EXPO.
